**INTRODUCTION**

In today's competitive skincare industry, data-driven decision-making is vital for staying ahead of evolving market trends and consumer behavior. This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a 2022 skincare dataset, with the objective of uncovering insights into sales performance and customer patterns across multiple markets and product segments.

The dataset includes transactional and customer-related data across various geographic regions, customer segments, and product sub-categories. It provides a rich foundation for evaluating key performance indicators such as revenue, profit, product demand, discount behavior, and customer distribution.

 
To enable actionable insights, the analysis was divided into two focus areas:

**Sales Dashboard:** Examining sales trends, profitability, and product performance.

**Customer Patterns Dashboard:** Identifying customer distribution, segment behavior, and market opportunities.


This report summarizes the findings from each dashboard and outlines strategic recommendations to support stakeholders such as Sales Managers, Marketing Executives, Customer Experience Teams, and Product Managers in driving growth, improving customer targeting, and optimizing operational strategy.



**INDUSTRY TYPE OF DATA**

Health & Wellness Industry - Beauty & Personal Care Segment. 

 

**STAKEHOLDERS OF THE ANALYSIS**

The Sales Managers, Marketing Executives, Customer Experience Teams, and the Product Managers. 

 

**WHAT SUCCESS MEANS TO THE STAKEHOLDERS**

To the Stakeholders, success means Strong Sales and Profitability, High Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty, Effective Market Penetration and Operational Efficiency.

 

**DATA LIMITATIONS OR BIASES**

Lack of Demographic Data: The dataset does not include demographic information such as age, gender, or income, which limits the depth of customer segmentation and behavioral analysis.

Limited Time Frame: The data covers only the year 2022. As a result, long-term trends, seasonality across years, or evolving customer preferences could not be fully assessed.

No Cost Data: The dataset does not include cost-of-goods-sold (COGS), which prevents a detailed profitability or margin analysis beyond basic profit calculations.

Discount Impact Ambiguity: While discounts are captured, there is no indication of baseline prices or customer satisfaction, making it difficult to fully interpret the impact of discounts on purchasing behavior.
